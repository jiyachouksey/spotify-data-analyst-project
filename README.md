# 🎧 Spotify Data Analyst Project

## 📌 Objective
Analyze Spotify tracks dataset to derive insights about song features, artist popularity, and genre trends, and visualize them effectively for business understanding.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Imported and cleaned dataset (handled null values, removed duplicates)
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and key metrics
3. Identified:
   - Top 10 most popular songs
   - Top 10 artists with maximum songs
   - Most popular genres
4. Plotted:
   - Distribution of song duration
   - Histograms of danceability, energy, tempo
   - Correlation heatmap to study relationships between features
5. Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with:
   - KPI cards for total tracks and average popularity
   - Top artists bar chart
   - Scatter plots and distribution visuals for audio features

## 💡 Key Insights
- Top artist: [Replace with your result, e.g. "Drake"] with [X] tracks
- Most popular genre: [Replace with your result, e.g. "Pop"] with average popularity of [A]
- Majority of songs are 3-4 minutes long
- Popularity has [weak/moderate/strong] correlation with danceability and energy
